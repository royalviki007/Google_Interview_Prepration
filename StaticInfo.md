## What is it?

![Coding at the whiteboard - from HBO's Silicon Valley](https://d3j2pkmjtin6ou.cloudfront.net/coding-at-the-whiteboard-silicon-valley.png)

This is my multi-month study plan for becoming a software engineer for a large company. 

**Required:** 
* A little experience with coding (variables, loops, methods/functions, etc)
* Patience
* Time

Note this is a study plan for **software engineering**, not web development.
